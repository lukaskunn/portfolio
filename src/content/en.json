The objective was to create a digital flagship that didn't just display products, but extended the physical experience of their concept store in Avenida Paulista. The platform serves a dual audience: end-consumers seeking inspiration and, crucially, architects and specifiers looking for technical resources and workspace.</p><h3>Key Features & User Experience</h3><p>The project required complex logic to bridge the gap between visual inspiration and technical specification:</p><ol><li><h4>Interactive \"Living Environments\" Showroom</h4><p>The core technical achievement is the \"Viver Ambientes\" module. I developed an immersive \"Shop the Look\" experience where users explore high-fidelity architectural photography.</p><p><strong>The Interaction:</strong> Using custom hover states and transitions, users can interact with specific elements within a scene (e.g., a faucet or floor tile).</p><p><strong>The Logic:</strong> This action triggers a dynamic product shelf that pulls real-time data for the tagged items, allowing the user to view the specific SKU, technical description, and finish options without leaving the inspiration context.</p></li><li><h4>Service Integration & Scheduling</h4><p>To support the \"Casa Dexco\" physical coworking space, I built a custom scheduling system. This feature invites professionals to book workspaces directly through the site. It involved creating a multi-step form validation flow that captures user data (CPF, profile type) and integrates with the backend to manage capacity.</p></li><li><h4>Geolocation & Store Locator</h4><p>To drive foot traffic, we implemented a robust map interface. Users can input their location to filter and find the nearest authorized resellers or showrooms, visualizing the extensive network of Dexco partners across Brazil.</p></li></ol></div>",

I focused heavily on Micro-interactions, creating smooth CSS transitions and hover effects that mimic the premium feel of the physical products.</p><h4>Backend</h4><p>Custom Node.js middlewares were developed to handle specific business rules, such as the scheduling logic and specific product catalog queries that standard VTEX APIs didn't cover out-of-the-box.</p><h3>The Impact</h3><p>The result is a seamless digital ecosystem that acts as a true extension of the Casa Dexco brand, functional enough for an architect's daily workflow, yet visually rich enough to inspire a homeowner's renovation.</p></div>",

          "descriptionLeft": "<div><h3>Project Overview</h3><p>While the institutional site inspires, the Casa Dexco Store is built to convert. This project involved a complete redesign and re-platforming of the direct-to-consumer e-commerce channel for brands like Deca, Portinari, and Hydra. The objective was to build a robust, scalable retail machine capable of handling high-traffic events like Black Friday while managing complex logistics behind a clean, user-friendly interface.</p><h3>Technical Challenges & Logical Architecture</h3><p>Built on VTEX IO with React, the frontend appears deceptively simple. However, the backend architecture handles significant complexity to ensure a seamless checkout flow:</p><ol><li><h4>Intelligent Seller Routing (White Label)</h4><p>The most critical feature is the geolocation logic. Since inventory is distributed across various centers, I implemented a validation system where the user's Zip Code (CEP) dynamically filters the entire catalog.</p><p><strong>The Logic:</strong> The application identifies the user's location and routes the session to the correct \"White Label\" seller. This ensures that the pricing, stock availability, and shipping estimates shown in the cart are 100% accurate for that specific region.</p></li><li><h4>Custom Identity Management</h4><p>We moved beyond standard login flows to create a segmented identification system. The platform identifies the user type (End Consumer vs. Architect/Specifier) during the authentication process. This allows for future scalability in offering differentiated pricing or B2B-specific features.</p></li></ol></div>",
          "descriptionRight": "<div><h3>Retail Features & \"Black Season\"</h3><p>To maximize conversion during retail peaks, I engineered specific \"Urgency Triggers\" that required real-time data validation:</p><ul><li><strong>Aggregated Stock Counter:</strong> I developed a component that checks stock availability across multiple sellers simultaneously. If the total inventory dips below a certain threshold, a \"Low Stock\" warning is triggered on the UI to encourage immediate purchase.</li><li><strong>Promotion Timers:</strong> A dynamic countdown timer was integrated into the Collection pages, synchronized with the backend trade policies to ensure promotions expire automatically without manual content updates.</li></ul><h3>The Result</h3><p>The redesign delivered a modern, friction-free shopping experience. From the structured Product Detail Pages (PDP) to the transparent checkout resume, the new architecture ensures that complex business rules never interfere with the user's path to purchase.</p></div>",

Unlike a standard e-commerce store, this platform is dedicated to brand storytelling, showcasing global partnerships, environmental initiatives (ESG), and technological breakthroughs. The challenge was to deliver a visually immersive experience that could be localized and managed easily across dozens of regions without constant developer intervention.</p><h3>The Engineering Breakthrough: \"No-Code\" Architecture</h3><p>The standard approach for landing pages is often rigid and hardcoded. For Motoverse, I architected a Dynamic Component System that revolutionized how the marketing team creates content.</p><p><strong>The Solution:</strong> I leveraged VTEX IO and React to build a library of flexible, reusable blocks. Instead of writing code for every new campaign, I exposed these components through the VTEX Site Editor.</p><p><strong>The Impact:</strong> This effectively created a custom \"Drag-and-Drop\" page builder. Content managers can now assemble complex layouts, positioning text, hero banners, and interactive galleries, completely independently. This reduced the \"Time-to-Live\" for new campaigns from days to minutes.</p></div>",

I led the frontend development and backend service integration for Motorola's European Store, a unified platform serving 30 distinct markets. The objective was to create a high-performance shopping experience that balances the brand's visual storytelling with the rigid logistical requirements of selling electronics across borders.</p><h3>Complex Commerce & Backend Logic</h3><p>Unlike standard retail sites, selling smartphones involves complex post-sale services and dynamic pricing models. I engineered custom Node.js middlewares on VTEX IO to handle these specific business rules:</p><ol><li><h4>MotoCare (Warranty Intelligence)</h4><p>I developed the integration for MotoCare, Motorola's extended warranty service. This wasn't a simple \"add-to-cart\" product.</p><p><strong>The Challenge:</strong> The system needed to verify if a specific device (SKU) was eligible for coverage and check if the warranty window was still open for that user.</p><p><strong>The Solution:</strong> I built a backend service that intercepts the user's session, validates the device data in real-time against the MotoCare API, and dynamically injects the correct warranty options into the checkout flow.</p></li><li><h4>Dynamic Trade-In Engine</h4><p>To incentivize device upgrades, we implemented a robust Trade-In system.</p><p><strong>The Logic:</strong> This feature allows users to exchange their old devices for credit. I implemented the frontend logic to capture the old device's condition and model, which communicates with the pricing engine to calculate a real-time discount. This discount is then applied programmatically to the cart, reducing the checkout friction significantly.</p></li></ol></div>",

    "intro": "I am a Creative Software Engineer based in São Paulo with over 5 years of experience architecting digital ecosystems for global brands. I specialize in the intersection of technical performance and visual immersion, transforming complex backend logic into fluid, motion-rich user interfaces that push the boundaries of modern web design.",
    "background": {
      "title": "My Background",
      "paragraphs": [
        "At 24, I am operating as a Full-Stack Developer with a focus on enterprise architecture. Currently, I am engineering the Casa Dexco Store, a high-performance e-commerce ecosystem built on VTEX IO. My work bridges the gap between complex business logic, such as intelligent \"white label\" seller routing and dynamic inventory management, and the premium, responsive frontend experience required by a market leader. I don't just write code; I build scalable commerce tools that drive real revenue.",
        "My passion for engineering is rooted in deep computer science. I graduated with honors, receiving recognition for my final paper on Computer Vision and Disease Identification in agriculture. This background gave me a strong foundation in algorithmic thinking, a skill I keep sharp by constantly challenging myself.",
        "I believe the web is the ultimate canvas. I am currently deep-diving into Creative Development, pushing the boundaries of the browser with Three.js, GSAP, and WebGL. My goal is to transform standard static layouts into fluid, motion-rich experiences.",
        "When I’m not pushing to production, I’m usually refining my craft or decompressing. You can find me grinding algorithmic challenges on LeetCode (optimizing solutions is my version of a workout), capturing street photography around São Paulo, or relaxing with a competitive gaming session. I believe that a sharp mind requires a chill vibe."
