/**
 * TypeScript types for Sanity CMS content
 *
 * @deprecated This file re-exports types from the centralized @/types module.
 * Import directly from '@/types' instead of this file.
 *
 * Usage:
 * import type { Project, Landing, AboutMe } from '@/types'
 */

// Re-export all types from centralized types
export * from '@/types'

/**
 * Note: All Sanity-related types have been moved to src/types/index.ts
 * This file is kept for backward compatibility but should not be used for new code.
